						<div class="about-text">
							<p>B Ward Electrical Ltd is a family based company that has had electricians in its family for over 60 years. It started out as Walker and Ward, with Danny Ward and George Walker, it has always had the same philosophy, “To do a job correctly as if it were your own”, no exceptions.</p>
							<p>Mr Ward and Mr Walker have now retired and now past the torch onto myself. I intend to carry on the training and experience that I was luckily enough to receive from them both. B Ward Electrical Ltd has got experience in every circle of life, from installing an outside light to rewiring a Cathedral. In my opinion, all work is good work, and we take the same amount of pride and perfection in every job we do.</p>
							<p class="text-title">Who we are</p>
							<p>We are a growing company that offers a fast friendly service, we strive to advise and implement what you, the client wants. We are based in Edinburgh, but have travelled all over Scotland, and the UK.</p>
							<p class="text-title">What we do</p>
							<p>We offer a full friendly service from, an initial meeting regarding an estimate for any type of works that is required; to a walk round regarding once the job is complete to make sure you are 100 % satisfied.</p>
